<ul class="link-list">
    <li>	
Founded in 1836, the City of Houston had a population of 2.1 million at the beginning of 2010. Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States (trailing only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago), and is the largest in the southern U.S. and Texas.
    </li>
 <li>	
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Houston CMSA) consists of ten counties: Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, San Jacinto and Waller. As of 2010 the metro area's population of 6.1 million is 6th largest among U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. Between 2000 and 2010, Houston's CMSA grew 26.1 percent.
    </li>
    <li>
The Houston CMSA covers 8,778 square miles, an area slightly smaller than Massachusetts but larger than New Jersey.
    </li>
    <li>
The Houston CMSA's Gross Area Product in 2012 was $395.4 billion, according to The Perryman Group - slightly larger than Belgium's or Sweden's GDP, and 42 percent larger than Hong Kong's. Only 18 nations have a Gross Domestic Product exceeding Houston's GAP.
    </li>
<li>	
The Houston CMSA recorded 2,862.5 million payroll jobs in January '13 - more than the job counts of 30 states, including Arizona, Colorado, and Louisiana.
    </li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Houston, a vibrant metropolitan community, was the fastest growing city in the United States in the 20th century, according to American City Business Journals. The area's population has increased at a rate of 2.9% per annum since 1995 and some 4,000% since 1900 making it the fasting growing city in the United States for the past 100 years! More than four million people live in the metropolitan area.</p>

    <p>While still a major refinery center, Houston has managed to diversify its business base so the local economy does not follow the drastic rise and fall of oil prices. Houston also features one of the largest ports in the world.</p>
