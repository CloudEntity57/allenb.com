            <h1>HOUSTON METROPOLITAN AREA</h1>
            <h2>About Houston </h2>
 
            <div class="picture-box">
                <a href = "Houston_HDR.jpg"><img src="Houston_HDR.jpg" alt="Downtown Houston" width="100%"></a>

            <p>Houston  is the nation's fourth largest city, second only to New York in Fortune 500 headquarters, and home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest, and NASA's Johnson Space Center. It is one of only six American cities with resident professional companies in all four major performing arts: ballet, opera, theater and symphony. It's a prime stop for touring companies from Broadway; concerts and shows, from the Rolling Stones to Cirque du Soleil; and exhibitions for every interest, ranging from the nation's largest quilting show to auto, boat and home shows.</p>

            <p>Houston's outstanding museum district includes the renowned Museum of Natural Science and Museum of Fine Arts. The New York Times called Houston possibly the most interesting city in America for young artists. New stadiums host NFL, Major League Baseball, NBA, Women's NBA and IHL teams. And extensive parks, theme parks and the nearby Gulf of Mexico offer outdoor and water recreation.</p>





            <p>Houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of Buffalo Bayou. It was incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837, and named after then-President of the Republic of Texas—former General Sam Houston—who had commanded at the Battle of San Jacinto, which took place 25 miles (40 km) east of where the city was established.</p>

            <p>The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-twentieth century, Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, where the Mission Control Center is located.</p>

            <p>Rated as a global city, Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters. The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.</p>
