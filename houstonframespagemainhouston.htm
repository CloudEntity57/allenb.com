            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Houston&nbsp; is the nation's fourth 
            largest city, second only to New York in Fortune 500 headquarters, 
            and home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest, and 
            NASA's Johnson Space Center. It is one of only six American cities 
            with resident professional companies in all four major performing 
            arts: ballet, opera, theater and symphony. It's a prime stop for 
            touring companies from Broadway; concerts and shows, from the 
            Rolling Stones to Cirque du Soleil; and exhibitions for every 
            interest, ranging from the nation's largest quilting show to auto, 
            boat and home shows.<br>
            <br>
            Houston's outstanding museum district includes the renowned Museum 
            of Natural Science and Museum of Fine Arts. The<i> New York Times</i> 
            called Houston possibly the most interesting city in America for 
            young artists. New stadiums host NFL, Major League Baseball, NBA, 
            Women's NBA and IHL teams. And extensive parks, theme parks and the 
            nearby Gulf of Mexico offer outdoor and water recreation.</font></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0D0D0D">Houston was 
founded in 1836 on land near the banks of Buffalo&nbsp;Bayou. It was incorporated as 
a city on June 5, 1837, and named after then-President of the Republic of 
Texas—former General Sam Houston—who had commanded at the Battle of San&nbsp;Jacinto, 
which took place 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) east of where the city was established. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0D0D0D">The 
burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has 
induced continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-twentieth century, 
Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest 
concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space 
Center, where the Mission Control Center is located. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0D0D0D">Rated as a 
global city, Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, 
manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health 
care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more 
Fortune&nbsp;500 headquarters. The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States 
in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage 
handled. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds 
and a large and growing international community. It is home to many cultural 
institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7&nbsp;million visitors a year to 
the Museum&nbsp;District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in 
the Theater&nbsp;District and offers year-round resident companies in all major 
performing arts.</span></p>
