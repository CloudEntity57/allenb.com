            <p>Houston  is the nation's fourth largest city, second only to New York in Fortune 500 headquarters, and home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest, and NASA's Johnson Space Center. It is one of only six American cities with resident professional companies in all four major performing arts: ballet, opera, theater and symphony. It's a prime stop for touring companies from Broadway; concerts and shows, from the Rolling Stones to Cirque du Soleil; and exhibitions for every interest, ranging from the nation's largest quilting show to auto, boat and home shows.</p>

            <p>Houston's outstanding museum district includes the renowned Museum of Natural Science and Museum of Fine Arts. The New York Times called Houston possibly the most interesting city in America for young artists. New stadiums host NFL, Major League Baseball, NBA, Women's NBA and IHL teams. And extensive parks, theme parks and the nearby Gulf of Mexico offer outdoor and water recreation.</p>


            <p>Houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of Buffalo Bayou. It was incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837, and named after then-President of the Republic of Texas—former General Sam Houston—who had commanded at the Battle of San Jacinto, which took place 25 miles (40 km) east of where the city was established.</p>

            <p>The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-twentieth century, Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, where the Mission Control Center is located.</p>

            <p>Rated as a global city, Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters. The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.</p>

    <li>	
Founded in 1836, the City of Houston had a population of 2.1 million at the beginning of 2010. Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States (trailing only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago), and is the largest in the southern U.S. and Texas.
    </li>
 <li>	
The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Houston CMSA) consists of ten counties: Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, San Jacinto and Waller. As of 2010 the metro area's population of 6.1 million is 6th largest among U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. Between 2000 and 2010, Houston's CMSA grew 26.1 percent.
    </li>
    <li>
The Houston CMSA covers 8,778 square miles, an area slightly smaller than Massachusetts but larger than New Jersey.
    </li>
    <li>
The Houston CMSA's Gross Area Product in 2012 was $395.4 billion, according to The Perryman Group - slightly larger than Belgium's or Sweden's GDP, and 42 percent larger than Hong Kong's. Only 18 nations have a Gross Domestic Product exceeding Houston's GAP.
    </li>
<li>	
The Houston CMSA recorded 2,862.5 million payroll jobs in January '13 - more than the job counts of 30 states, including Arizona, Colorado, and Louisiana.
    </li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Houston, a vibrant metropolitan community, was the fastest growing city in the United States in the 20th century, according to American City Business Journals. The area's population has increased at a rate of 2.9% per annum since 1995 and some 4,000% since 1900 making it the fasting growing city in the United States for the past 100 years! More than four million people live in the metropolitan area.</p>

    <p>While still a major refinery center, Houston has managed to diversify its business base so the local economy does not follow the drastic rise and fall of oil prices. Houston also features one of the largest ports in the world.</p>

     <p>According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558 km2); this comprises 579.4 square miles (1,501 km2) of land and 22.3 square miles (58 km2) of water. Most of Houston is located on the flat, gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie, which are all still visible in surrounding areas. Downtown stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation.</p>

     <p>Houston has four major bayous passing through the city. Buffalo Bayou runs through downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak Bayou, which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Braes Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of Mexico.<br>

During '02-'30, The Perryman Group sees population growth averaging 1.54 percent annually in the Houston region. Over the same period, this prominent Texas-based economic forecasting firm expects employment to rise at a 1.94 percent annual rate.
    </li>
    <li>
Employment growth faster than the nation's is predicated in part on disproportionately rapid growth in economic base employment, especially in energy-independent sectors. Says M. Ray Perryman, Ph.D., the firm's president: "The area's traditional dependence on energy-related business is projected to continue to decrease over this period. [Houston's] economic expansion is fueled by its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as by the important role the area plays as a major manufacturing, shipping, and tourism center. Global economic growth will greatly benefit [the area's] export and import enterprises."

Between the '90 and the '00 censuses, the population of the Houston Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) grew 25.2 percent, according to the Census Bureau. The nation's population increased 13.2 percent over the same period.
    </li>
    <li>
Net migration accounts for 49 percent of Houston's population growth since '90. Given Houston's prominence in international business, it is perhaps not surprising that foreign immigration accounts for an overwhelming 78 percent of net migration (some 451,000 people) since '90.
    </li>
    <li>
Houston, which prizes its ethnic diversity as a source of strength in a global economy, is becoming still more diverse. The '00 census found that no racial or ethnic group now constitutes a majority of the metro area population; by '30, under reasonable scenarios, Hispanics could become a majority. Asians - nearly 5 percent of the population in '00 - will climb to 10 percent within the next two decades.
    </li>
    <li>
Among the nation's largest metropolitan areas, the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria CMSA ranks fifth in Hispanic population (1,457,800 in '02, according to Sales &amp; Marketing Management) and 10th in Asian & Pacific Islander population (248,700). Census data put Hispanics at 1,348,588 and Asians &amp; Pacific Islanders at 227,909 in '00.

     <h3>LARGE SUBURBAN CITIES IN WEST ARE FASTEST GROWING</h3>

     <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. (U.S. Census Bureau) – Large suburban cities in the West dominated the list of America's fastest-growing cities, according to population estimates released by the U. S. Census Bureau.</p>

     <p>Between April 1, 2000, and July 1, 2002, Gilbert, Ariz., was the fastest-growing of 242 cities with populations of 100,000 or more.</p>
 
<p>The estimates show no change in the rankings of the ten largest cities since Census 2000. The ten largest U.S. cities as of July 1, 2002, in order of population were New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, Dallas, San Antonio and Detroit.
    Of the ten  largest cities, Phoenix and San Antonio grew the fastest from 2000 to 2002, followed by San Diego, Houston and Los Angeles.</p>
 
     <p>Austin was the only one of Texas’ 20 largest cities to lose population between 2000 and 2002. Its population shrank by 1,100.</p>

     <h5>Overall Real Estate Market</h5>

     <p>Houston is scoring high marks on all lists relating to housing and real estate and is expected to continue in 2013. It is likely to be sustainable due to strong population and job growth both in Houston and Texas. Home and apartment rents are rising while new construction in both are ramping up but not in excess to meet demand.</p>

 
     <h5>Single Family Residential</h5>

     <p>Houston home prices will rise as much as 5 percent in 2013.</p>

     <p>According to the University of Houston’s Institute for Regional Forecasting. Houston has a 3.7 month supply of homes for sale, the lowest since December 2000 and well below the 6 month supply considered to be balanced, the Houston Association of Realtors says. Metrostudy calculates the sustainable demand for new homes to be 32,000/year and Builders will likely start only 26,500 to 27,500.</p>

     <p>Densification in the inner loop will continue with townhouse development on former sites of single family homes that are not restricted.</p>

     <h5>Multi Family</h5>

     <p>Emerging Trends reports respondents from all areas of the US favor apartments more than any other property sector. 2013 like the previous year, will be another big year, while the single-family market continues to rebalance.</p>

     <p>Densification in the inner loop will continue following the  mid and high rise multi-family development on former sites of older apartments and other older unrestricted buildings with desirable site size and location.</p>

     <h5>Office</h5>

     <p>Houston with 4% of the US inventory,  accounts for 13.8 % of the US YTD office absorption as tech and energy-oriented markets continue to be the best performers according to Reis. Texas and West Coast markets have comprised the vast majority of US office market, according to Jones, Lang & LaSalle.</p>

     <h5>Retail</h5>

     <p>Trends in 2013 began in 2012 will continue with grocers in the lead including HEB, Kroger and Wall Mart along with specialty grocers Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Aldi, Sprouts and Fresh Market. In the Inner Loop look for new chef-driven restaurants including Uchi, Liberty Kitchen and Glorias and expansion of Ruggles and Madeleine.</p>

     <p>Mixed-use development is back in 2013 with Blvd Place in the Galleria, Highland Village and City Centre.</p>

     <p>In 2013 look for Big Boxes to downsize at some locations, while others relocate or build such as Costco, Target and Wal-Mart.</p>

     <h5>Industrial</h5>

     <p>Houston had more speculative starts (25) than build to suit starts (15) primarily by oil &amp; gas or energy related firms in 2012 to be completed in 2013. In 2013 look for less speculative starts with top submarkets in the North, Northwest and Southeast given their location near Bush Airport and the major strategic thoroughfares, Beltway 8, 290, I10 and I45.</p>

     <h5>Hotel</h5>

     <p>In 2013, driven by oil and gas exploration, the Texas markets of Austin, Houston and San Antonio continue to lead the nation in demand growth, along with New York and Tucson. It is not surprising that two Texas cities (San Antonio and Houston) are among the markets forecast to achieve the greatest gains in occupancy during 2013 according to hotel management. </p>

     <p> Houston has completed the recovery and is now in expansion mode.</p>

<p>Recession Snapshot: The recession hit Houston September ’08. The region lost 152,800 jobs through January ’10. Houston began to recoup jobs starting in February that year. By October ’11, the region had gained 153,000 jobs, or 101.1 percent of what it lost in the recession. Houston added more than 65,000 jobs between August 2010 and August 2011 alone.<br>

    The Greater Houston Partnership’s reported the 10-county Houston metro area added 95,800 jobs in 2012 with projections to add  76,000 in 2013.</p>

 

     <div class="blue">Economy benefits from high energy prices</div><br>

<p>The local economy continues to benefit from high energy prices, driving employment growth in the construction and mining sector which has risen 2.2% from a year ago. The professional and business services sector has also been driving growth with employment expanding 4% from its year-ago level. Unemployment in the metro is lower than the national average measuring 8.4% in the most recent month.

    We expect the strength in this metro to continue given its low costs of doing business and the continued strength in the energy complex.</p>

 <h3>TEXAS</h3>

The Lone Star is shining bright.<br>

     <p>The Texas real estate market is one of the few bright spots in the entire country. In fact, the Texas market has to be the brightest star still shining. First, we’ve got strong population growth, with over 2 million more Texans now than we had at the turn of the century. Second, our job growth is double the national average and likely to stay that way in 2013. Third, Texas is the place to live if you don’t like paying taxes. Not many states have a lower overall tax burden than we do. Fourth, Texas always ranks at or near the top of favorite places to relocate. Fifth, our housing is affordable and so is our lifestyle. It makes it easier for firms to attract workers when they can actually buy a home, too! And if those five factors aren’t enough, we still have the best Mexican food on the planet.</p>

     <p>Texas outpaces nation</p>

     <p>Despite the doom-and-gloom reports on the national scene, overall expect 2013 to be another busy year for residential and commercial real estate professionals south of the Red River.</p>
