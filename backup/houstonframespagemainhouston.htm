            largest city, second only to New York in Fortune 500 headquarters, 
            and home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest, and 
            NASA's Johnson Space Center. It is one of only six American cities 
            with resident professional companies in all four major performing 
            arts: ballet, opera, theater and symphony. It's a prime stop for 
            touring companies from Broadway; concerts and shows, from the 
            Rolling Stones to Cirque du Soleil; and exhibitions for every 
            interest, ranging from the nation's largest quilting show to auto, 
            boat and home shows.<br>
            <br>
            Houston's outstanding museum district includes the renowned Museum 
            of Natural Science and Museum of Fine Arts. The<i> New York Times</i> 
            called Houston possibly the most interesting city in America for 
            young artists. New stadiums host NFL, Major League Baseball, NBA, 
            Women's NBA and IHL teams. And extensive parks, theme parks and the 
            nearby Gulf of Mexico offer outdoor and water recreation.</font></p>
