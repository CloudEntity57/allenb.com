        <td width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="georgia,times new roman,times"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With interest rates 
        rising and consumer confidence waning, more analysts are beginning to 
        question how the national economic recovery can be sustained. Analysts 
        from Wall Street to Pennsylvania Avenue are lowering their forecasts for 
        2005, expecting GDP growth to decline over 2004's performance by a full 
        percentage point or more.<br>
        <br>
        The primary focus of all these dismal forecasts is upon the consumer. 
        The consumer is worried about the future, cringing at every piece of bad 
        news from the Middle East. They are strapped for cash, having loaded up 
        their credit card debt to the limit and having exhausted their home 
        equities to pay for past excesses. Furthermore, they soon will be 
        worrying about that home equity which is likely to shrink over the next 
        several years instead of constantly refilling their Midas cups of 
        perpetual wealth. The bottom line is that the consumer is not going to 
        be of any significant help in promoting nation-wide growth. While it is 
        unlikely, with the labor market improving, that the consumer will 
        totally become a shrinking violet, they are likely to spend in short 
        spurts, covering holiday and back-to-school obligations and otherwise 
        limiting themselves to bargains.<br>
        <br>
        So what’s going to keep the U.S. economy from tumbling? Where’s the 
        strength going to come to buoy the economy up in the absence of consumer 
        strength? It will come from several places.<br>
        <br>
        However, let’s first look at some positive influences upon the consumer 
        that will keep them from completely dying on the vine. The most 
        important will be falling energy prices. This will return billions of 
        dollars back into consumer’s pocketbooks. Second, is job growth. The 
        current 1.5% national rate of job creation will add more than 1.5% to 
        real dollar spending since real per capita income will also be growing 
        (though rather meagerly) In a world of 2.5% inflation, that alone should 
        generate increases in retail sales of at least 4.0%. That’s not very 
        impressive, but it is at least positive. <br>
        <br>
        The really encouraging news, however, comes from the other sectors of 
        the national economy. The decline in the dollar will be an even greater 
        boon to U.S. exports next year than this year. Ah, the cries of our 
        trading partners in Asia and Europe ought to be music to our ears. It 
        means that the dollars decline is beginning to hurt abroad, and that’s 
        exactly what it needed to do. U.S. exports are pushing up towards all 
        time highs and the numbers will be much more impressive next year. In 
        addition, the national preoccupation with bargains will keep industry 
        constantly at work to lower costs. That will translate into more 
        productivity enhancing technological investment. Business investment 
        experienced a nice rebound in 2004 and the upward trend will continue 
        through next year. Look for growth in the double digit range again. 
        Finally, the economy will continue to benefit from the excessive amount 
        of fiscal stimulus emanating from Washington. While that’s bad in the 
        long-run, it continues to a be positive in the short-run. So, don’t 
        write off the economy quite so soon. If you’re bent on worrying, focus 
        more on 2006 and 2007. </font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Houston Chronicle 
        reported after this fall’s symposium that we were suggesting the 
        likelihood of a recession within the next couple of years. While that 
        possibility cannot be totally ruled out, the tone of the Chronicle 
        article was somewhat more pessimistic than we intended.&nbsp;&nbsp; The risk of a 
        recession stems from the vulnerability of U.S. consumers who never 
        retreated from their spending spree during the past recession.&nbsp; Thus, 
        they remain over-extended and excessively dependent upon continued 
        rising home equities, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur.&nbsp; Indeed, 
        we spent a considerable amount of time at the symposium explaining why a 
        housing bust in this nation’s most inflated markets was virtually 
        assured. Furthermore, because this bust would affect nearly a third of 
        all Americans, it would have serious negative implications to the 
        national economy.&nbsp; While we indicated that the ills of these markets 
        were not significantly present in Houston, we also warned that Houston 
        would still be indirectly affected by the induced national slowdown such 
        a housing market correction would have on the overall local economy. 
        But, in our entire presentation we never mentioned the “r” word, 
        recession. (See the symposium report, “The Changing Face of Houston - 
        Implications for the Future”)</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;While we recognize 
        that the housing market has the potential to create a mild national 
        recession such as occurred in 1991, at this point we think it is 
        unlikely for several reasons.&nbsp; Helping to ameliorate the impact of a 
        housing bust will be the significant benefits of softening energy 
        prices, further declines in the dollar, and the continuing fiscal 
        stimulus of federal government spending. It is also true that the coming 
        economic environment, characterized by weak consumer spending stimulated 
        only by “bargains” and by stiff competition within the global economy, 
        will continue to promote a rebound in high tech, cost-cutting 
        technology.&nbsp; All of these together should help to compensate for the 
        wealth losses associated with home price declines as long as they remain 
        moderate (10 to 25% in those most vulnerable markets).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we are 
        only forecasting a slowdown in the national growth rate by 2006 or 2007, 
        not a recession.&nbsp;&nbsp; How severe that slowdown becomes greatly depends upon 
        the application of wise monetary policy which at this point 
        unfortunately can not be counted on.&nbsp; Once again, the FED needs to 
        monitor a national asset market (the home market this time instead of 
        the stock market) as much as overall macro economic statistics.&nbsp; Our 
        worry stems from the fact that each time the Greenspan FED has faced 
        this challenge they’ve failed. (See Director’s Comments on this web 
        site)&nbsp;&nbsp; We are among many that believe that the housing market 
        correction need not produce a recession if wise monetary policy is 
        pursued. We’ll have to wait and see. </font>&nbsp;</p>
