                <td width="100%" bgColor="#ffffff"><!--mstheme--><font face="georgia,times new roman,times">Recently the news headlines 
                indicated that 1,600 jobs were gone from the Houston economy as 
                though this were new news. However, while that headline’s 
                numbers were accurate, the message was misleading. For better or 
                for worse, we all must rely on the employment numbers produced 
                by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and its cohort, the Texas 
                Workforce Commission. Earlier this month they revised Houston’s 
                employment total downward by about 14,000 jobs, strangely 
                deducting almost all of that revision from the July, 2003's 
                total. However, other than the quirky way they allocated the 
                changes, the new BLS/TWC numbers actually make more sense than 
                the original ones. <br>
                <br>
                In many ways the new employment series doesn’t change the 
                general historical picture of the Houston economy dramatically, 
                but it now shows that the first half of 2003 was worse than we 
                were at first led to believe and the second half was actually 
                somewhat better. Yes, it is true that in comparison with 
                February 2003 employment in Houston was 1,600 less last month 
                (February 2004). But too many treat urban statistics like this 
                as though they have the same meaning and interpretation as the 
                national data we all hear about every month. However, it just 
                isn’t so. <br>
                <br>
                National data typically compares employment on a month to month 
                basis. Thus, we know how many jobs were created just last month. 
                That’s good up-to-date data. The BLS can do this with national 
                data because the data, based on the large national sample, is 
                stable enough and because they have years of data which allow 
                them to seasonally adjust the numbers. Thus, the next time you 
                hear a news report on national employment, the number reported 
                will be a seasonally adjusted number. <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, all local employment data is unadjusted. 
                Thus, month to month comparison’s can be very confusing. In 
                Houston we always add 12 to 15 thousand jobs each November and 
                December for Christmas. In January those jobs all go away. In 
                June or July we lose a substantial amount of local government 
                employment from area schools. In September we get them back 
                again. <br>
                <br>
                To avoid the seasonality confusion most analysts simply compare 
                the most recent month’s statistics with the numbers from the 
                same month a year ago, the presumption being (which is not 
                always perfectly correct) that you are comparing apples and 
                apples (March against March). Of course, the problem with these 
                12 month job growth numbers is they don’t really tell you much 
                about what’s happening right now, and today this has never been 
                more true for Houston. Yes, Houston’s employment is 1,600 less 
                than last February, but the real story is that Houston shed 
                about 25,000 jobs during the first half of 2003, only to gain 
                all but 1,600 of those jobs back during the past 6 months. That 
                paints a very different picture of Houston’s current economy 
                than the simple headline that 1,600 jobs are gone.<br>
                <br>
                The fact is that the data show Houston’s employment picture 
                improving rather dramatically, much more so than the national 
                economy. Since August, Houston employment has increased 
                approximately 1.25%. That translates into an average annualized 
                growth rate of 2.59%. That’s not bad at all. In fact, that’s 
                much better than we anticipated last November at our annual 
                Forecast Symposium. I’m not arguing yet that the Houston economy 
                is advancing at full throttle, but it is certainly making 
                progress, better than anticipated, better than the nation, and 
                certainly better than the simple 12 month comparative story 
                would leave you to believe. For more information on the current 
                direction of the Houston economy, see our discussions in 
                DATABook Houston and the May release of our Spring 2004 
                Symposium report.
