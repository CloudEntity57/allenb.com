  <font face="Arial" size="2">COLLEGE STATION, Texas (recenter.tamu.edu) – If 
  land prices were on fire last year, they skyrocketed into space this year, 
  says Dr. Charles E. Gilliland, research economist with the Real Estate Center 
  at Texas A&amp;M University. A typical tract of land sold for $1,273 per acre in 
  2004. A year ago, a typical tract sold for $1,097. In other words, land prices 
  appreciated 16 percent in 2004.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Prices were up in all regions of the state. The 
  greatest appreciation statewide was in the Canadian Breaks, where prices were 
  up 41 percent. In the Coastal Prairie-South they were up 38 percent; in the 
  Panhandle North, 37 percent; and in the Piney Woods-South, 35 percent. </font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">The market did not take a breather in 2004, as 
  7,833 land sales were reported to the Center, an 8 percent increase in sales 
  volume compared with 2003. Sales of properties of all sizes soared, with small 
  property prices up 29 percent and typical-size property prices up 19 percent 
  statewide. </font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">The latest Center research shows that farmland 
  values respond to nonfarm factors more than to agricultural factors. &gt;From 
  1986 to 1993, farming had the most influence on land prices. Today, 
  agricultural lending groups are saying there is not much of a relationship 
  between agricultural production and land prices. Data indicates that is the 
  case. However, there was a high correlation (95.5 percent) between personal 
  income not related to agriculture and land prices from 1993 through 2004.&nbsp;
  </font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Gilliland projects that if the current conditions 
  persist, land values will appreciate 10 percent in 2005, reaching $1,380 per 
  acre, and by 2010, prices will be 57 percent higher than 2004 prices, reaching 
  $1,969 per acre. </font>

                in Waco. Economic forecaster Barton Smith has a similar view. 
                &quot;Most area real estate markets will enjoy a better environment 
                in 2003. The exception will be the single-family residential 
                market. Much of the increased occupancy in the apartment market, 
                however, will come at the expense of lower growth in single

                2004 first quarter sales surpassed 2003’s first quarter sales by 
                13.8 percent. According to the Houston Association of Realtors'® 
                Multiple Listing Service (MLS), total property sales in March, 
                consisting of single-family homes, town homes, multi-family 
                homes, country homes, high-rise properties and lots listed by

                month; this is great news for Houston's economy,&quot; said HAR

                that the MLS system serves as an aggregate for all of Houston as 
                well as its surrounding counties. Sales may be brisk in one area 
                and not necessarily the other.&quot; Available inventory in the 
                greater-Houston area also escalated. Realtors® listed 
                approximately 12.4 percent more properties in the MLS system 
                last month compared to March 2003. There are some 39,660 
                Realtor® listings in the system, with 4,519 sales slated to 
                close during the next month. The median price of single-family 
                homes reached $130,430 in March, the highest median price ever 
                recorded for that month. <br>

                non-negative job growth. The volume of calls from prospective 
                renters has been steadily rising, according to leasing agents. 
                Absorption of units was up in the quarter with 299 units

                nation's largest jump in apartment building, where ongoing 
                construction as of January 2003 (10,436 units) jumped a whopping 
                73 percent from the level recorded in January 2002 (6,043 
                units). Of the product currently under way, half (5,377 units) 
                is scheduled to come on stream in 2003's first six months. 
                Though new completions are expected to slow in the year's latter 
                half, construction has already begun on more than 3,000 units 
                with completion dates targeted for sometime in 2004. On top of 
                that, multifamily permit statistics suggest that a large chunk 
                of future product is on the horizon. Permits were issued for 
                approximately 10,800 multifamily units during 2002, nearly 
                doubling the number of units approved in 2001 and ranking third 
                in the nation. Construction is currently heaviest in the 
                Katy/Southwest Houston submarket, where building has been 
                initiated on 2,524 units. A particularly active cluster in this 
                submarket is the neighborhood just south of the Energy Corridor 
                but west of Eldridge Parkway, where three apartment communities 
                that each top 300 units (Camden Oak Crest, Villas at West Oaks 
                and San Brisas) are in process. Another 270-unit complex 
                (Bridges of Eldridge) is under construction nearby. However, 
                Houston's apartment market has struggled as of late. According 
                to M/PF Research's 4th quarter survey, the Houston area 
                experienced net move-outs of approximately 5,110 units during 
                the October-December 2002 time frame, dropping occupancy 1.5 
                points from the September level to register at 92 percent as of 
                4th quarter. Though recent economic forecasts predict an 
                improved job market in 2003, the metropolitan Houston area is 
                unlikely to see a considerable improvement in apartment market 
                conditions, as occupancy is expected to inch up 0.1 point to 
                92.1 percent by December 2003.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

                up: six by H-E-B and four by Kroger. The report also noted that 
                the free-standing corner drug store concept pioneered by 
                Walgreens will keep popping up throughout Houston. No new Home 
                Depot stores or Lowe’s are planned for 2004, but several of each 
                are planned for 2005. One of the retail market’s biggest 
                challenges is what to do with the increasing number of closed 
                stores, including K-Mart, Lord &amp; Taylor and some Garden Ridge 
                stores, as well as vacancies created by relocations. There are 
                several ways to fill those spaces. In the case of 43 Albertson’s 
                stores that became vacant after the national grocer pulled out 
                of Houston, rival grocers took over a vast majority of those 
                locations, while 99 Cents Only acquired the distribution center. 
                In other instances, landlords can find unconventional, 
                non-retail tenants. For example, a large electronics store near 
                The Galleria became a Houston Community College branch. 
                According to the report, the parts of town that will see the 
                most retail growth are the Northwest Corridor, which includes 
                U.S. 290, Texas 249 and the towns of Tomball and Magnolia, as 
                well as The Woodlands.<br>

                <td><!--mstheme--><font face="georgia,times new roman,times">At the end of 2002, the Houston retail market reported an 
                overall occupancy of approximately 86 percent, down slightly 
                from year-end 2001’s occupancy rate of 86.8 percent. Occupancy 
                has been helped by retailer expansions as well as a slowdown in 
                retail construction. For 2002, construction totaled 
                approximately three million square feet, down significantly from 
                2001’s approximate six million square feet of new construction. 
                The majority of space was accounted for by the construction of 
                multitenant community centers with grocery store anchors, as 
                well as large-format tenants such as Kohl’s and SuperTarget and 
                junior anchors such as Office Depot and Ross Dress for Less. 
                Houston’s healthy occupancy situation looks stronger considering 
                store closings that occurred during 2002. Kmart closed 11 stores 
                as part of its bankruptcy, Albertsons left the market and 
                Weiner’s closed 25 locations. Auchan also announced in early 
                2003 that it is closing its two Houston locations. As of 
                year-end 2002, asking rental rates for Houston-area retail 
                projects remained stable, although they typically were not 
                showing increases. Concessions were available in some instances. 
                Rental rates at year-end 2002 were in line with rates at 
                mid-year, with Class-A space ranging from $18 to $20 per square 
                foot per year in the better markets for small-tenant in-line 
                space. Rates for well located outparcels were $25 or more per 
                square foot. For second-generation space in good locations, 
                rates typically were in the $15 to $16 per-square-foot range. 
                Class-C space typically ranged from $9 to $12 per square foot.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

                suffered from the recession and subsequent slower-than-expected 
                economic recovery, supply and demand fundamentals staggered with 
                a dramatic rise in vacancy caused by a brittle office employment 
                base. Due to the so-called jobless recovery, the prolonged 
                economic downturn significantly depressed tenant demand pushing 
                vacancy to its highest level since 1994. Meanwhile, business 
                contractions coupled with space completions added nearly 4.6 
                million square feet of vacant space onto the market and 
                magnified vacancy by 2.4 percent to 19.7 percent. Consequently, 
                the vacancy increase caps a two-year swing that has seen the 
                balance of power in the office market shift from landlords to 
                tenants, who now find multiple options for premium space at a 
                discount garnished with generous concession packages and 
                open-handed financial incentives. The CBD posted a monumental 
                tenant exodus during 2003 when large corporate evacuations 
                flooded the market with sublease space and over 1.5 million 
                square feet of new product. With nearly 8.5 million square feet 
                currently sitting dark, downtown vacancy is projected to climb 
                upward again this year as the addition of the former Enron Tower 
                further dilutes the already watery tenant demand. On the bright 
                side, there are tentative signs that the worst may be over for 
                the suburban office market resulting in an improved outlook by 
                the close of 2004 for Houston’s outlying office markets. 
                Although net absorption was down by more than 327,000 square 
                feet within the suburbs last year, this pressure was by far an 
                improvement over 2003, when negative absorption totaled 1.9 
                million square feet. The citywide sublease inventory will ease 
                over the next 12 to 18 months while construction activity will 
                be constrained, providing a welcome relief from the high levels 
                of new supply that hit in recent years. Since the commercial 
                real estate market typically lags the overall economy by six 
                months to a year, rents are likely to remain soft through at 
                least the first-half of this year before firming up much later 
                in 2004. <br>

                The prolonged economic downturn has depressed demand and allowed 
                high vacancy rates to become commonplace. Houston’s office 
                market had negative absorption of 315,021 square feet in the 
                first quarter. This is an improvement over last year, when

                sublet space. Tenants are taking advantage of market conditions

                now, it is a buyer’s/tenant’s market, but as we ride out the
