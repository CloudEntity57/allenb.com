<ul class="link-list">
    <li>As public records, the contract forms adopted by the Texas Real Estate Commission are available to any person.</li>
    <br>
    <li>However, <b>TREC contract forms are intended for use only by licensed real estate brokers or salespersons who are trained in their correct use.</b> Mistakes in the use of a form may result in financial loss or a contract which is unenforceable.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>If you are obtaining the forms for possible use in a real estate transaction, you should contact a real estate licensee or an attorney for assistance. TREC cannot provide legal advice to the public on private contractual matters.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <br>
    <b>TREC does not promulgate</b> listing or buyer representation agreements, property management contracts, forms for commercial property, or residential leases (other than temporary residential leases used in connection with a sale). Contact your attorney or a trade association for such forms.
